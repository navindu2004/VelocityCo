    <p>Turtles also known as Testudines are reptiles that has a special shell developed mainly from their ribs.Turtles
        are divided into two main groupd as Pleurodira(side necked turtles) and Cryptodira (hidden necked turtles)
        ,which differ according to the way their head retracts.There are about 360 living and recently extinct species
        of turtles.Turtles are normally rarely seen because sea is their home and only the female turtles come ashore
        and that too when its dark.The land turtles are seen very frequently.As for today there are 250 species of
        turtles on Earth.7 out of those live in the sea so they are called sea turtles.The other 243 species live in the
        land or in freshwater ponds and marshes.The terestrial turtles who lives solely on land are called
        Tortoises.Five species of sea turtles in the world visit Sri Lanka to breed.</p>
    <p>Turtles have appeared in myths and folktales around the world. Some terrestrial and freshwater species are widely
        kept as pets. Turtles have been hunted for their meat, for use in traditional medicine, and for their shells.
        Sea turtles are often killed accidentally as bycatch in fishing nets. Turtle habitats around the world are being
        destroyed. As a result of these pressures, many species are extinct or threatened with extinction.</p>

        Turtle shells are made mostly of bone; the upper part is the domed carapace, while the underside is the flatter
        plastron or belly-plate. Its outer surface is covered in scales made of keratin, the material of hair, horns,
        and claws. The carapace bones develop from ribs that grow sideways and develop into broad flat plates that join
        up to cover the body. Turtles are ectotherms or "cold-blooded", meaning that their internal temperature varies
        with their direct environment. They are generally opportunistic omnivores and mainly feed on plants and animals
        with limited movements. Many turtles migrate short distances seasonally. Sea turtles are the only reptiles that
        migrate long distances to lay their eggs on a favored beach.

    <h2>LIFESPAN</h2>
    <p>Turtles can live long lives. The oldest living turtle and land animal is said to be a Seychelles giant tortoise
        named Jonathan, who turned 187 in 2019. A Gal√°pagos tortoise named Harriet was collected by Charles Darwin in
        1835; it died in 2006, having lived for at least 176 years. Most wild turtles do not reach that age. Turtles
        keep growing new scutes under the previous scutes every year, allowing researchers to estimate how long they
        have lived. They also age slowly. The survival rate for adult turtles can reach 99% per year.</p>

    <h2>FOOD</h2>
    <p>Most turtle species are opportunistic omnivores; land-dwelling species are more herbivorous and aquatic ones more
        carnivorous.Generally lacking speed and agility, most turtles feed either on plant material or on animals with
        limited movements like mollusks, worms, and insect larvae.Some species, such as the African helmeted turtle and
        snapping turtles, eat fish, amphibians, reptiles (including other turtles), birds, and mammals. They may take
        them by ambush but also scavenge. The alligator snapping turtle has a worm-like appendage on its tongue that it
        uses to lure fish into its mouth. Tortoises are the most herbivorous group, consuming grasses, leaves, and
        fruits.Many turtle species, including tortoises, supplement their diet with eggshells, animal bones, hair, and
        droppings for extra nutrients.</p>

    <h2>HABITAT</h2>
    <p>Turtles have adapted to a remarkable variety of environments, but the greatest number of species occur in
        southeastern North America and South Asia. In both areas, most species are aquatic, living in bodies of water
        ranging from small ponds and bogs to large lakes and rivers. A few are strictly terrestrial (tortoises), and
        others divide their time between land and water.</p>
